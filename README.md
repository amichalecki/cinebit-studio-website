# Cinebit Studio - Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

1. Make changes
1. Commit
1. Deploy

## Deploy

1. After you push last commit just run `npm run deploy`
1. It will push your build to GitHub Pages
1. Then you need update domain `cinebitstudio.pl` link

```
this can be probably fixed by code, by now you need to do it evertime you deploy
```
